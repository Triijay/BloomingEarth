# Blooming Earth

Here you can find the code base and tests for the Android app "Blooming Earth".

The whole thing was built with Unity and published in the Google Play Store: [Blooming Earth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KaloaGames.BloomingEarth&hl=de&gl=US) 

The project was developed from May 2019 to January 2022 and distributed via the company "Kaloa Games" founded for this purpose.
Two developers ([Pascal Nees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-nees-60b33ba6/?originalSubdomain=de) and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-winkler-833010155)) worked on it part-time.
